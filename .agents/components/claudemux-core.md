# Component: the orchestration core

claudemux's `tm` CLI is implemented in TypeScript, living directly under
[`/plugins/claudemux/`](/plugins/claudemux), in the plugin root alongside
`bin/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, `templates/`, and the `.claude-plugin/` manifest.
The TypeScript sources are under [`src/`](/plugins/claudemux/src) and tests
under [`test/`](/plugins/claudemux/test); the suite uses **vitest**.

[Decision node-cli-orchestrator](/.agents/decisions/node-cli-orchestrator.md) set the
shape: the orchestrator is a **pure Node CLI** — `tm` in TypeScript, invoked
once per command, with no resident process and no MCP server. The architecture
is the domain spec,
[domains/node-cli-orchestrator.md](/.agents/domains/node-cli-orchestrator.md);
this document is the **component** view — what the orchestration modules are
and what contracts they hold.

## Module layout

Every module under [`src/`](/plugins/claudemux/src) is small and
single-purpose; routing, verb code, and process wiring each have their own home.

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `main.ts` | The process entrypoint — read `process.argv` / `process.stdin`, hand to `runCli`, write the result's streams to `process`, set `process.exitCode`. The `bin/tm` launcher execs Node against this file under `--experimental-transform-types`. |
| `cli.ts` | Stable public import surface for `runCli`, `productionEnv`, and `triggersHelp`; implementation lives in `cli/`. |
| `cli/dispatch.ts` | `runCli` and the verb table dispatch order: help forms, removed verbs, engine-routed teammate verbs, dispatcher-only diagnostics, and unknown-verb handling. |
| `cli/parse.ts` | Shared CLI parsing and request derivation: help pre-scan, timeout validation, `ctx` / `reload` target parsing, spawn engine inference, and Codex cwd derivation for resume/history. |
| `cli/errors.ts` | Shared `{code, stdout, stderr}` error/help result constructors for `tm:` errors, removed verbs, unknown verbs, and `tm help`. |
| `cli/context.ts` | Production per-invocation wiring: `NativeEnv`, `EngineRegistry`, `ProductionTeammateRouter`, live identity migrators, and `ProductionIdentityStore`. |
| `shared/verb-args.ts` | Shared teammate-verb argument parsers (`spawn`, `send`, `wait`, `compact`, `resume`) used by the CLI layer and Claude compatibility wrappers. Cross-engine flags such as `--engine` live here, not under `engines/claude/`. |
| `help.ts` | `HELP_TEXTS`, `OVERVIEW_HELP`, `REMOVED_VERB_MESSAGES` — the user-facing help strings, the single source of truth that `tm <verb> --help` and `tm help <verb>` print. |
| `verbs.ts` | `TM_VERBS` — the catalog of the 17 `tm` verbs. |
| `verbs/` | Verb-layer dispatch — `verbs/{ls,states,status,kill,spawn,send,wait,compact,resume,last,ctx,history,mem,reload}.ts` build engine requests, resolve teammate names through `identity/router.ts`, call engine methods, and format discriminated results through `verbs/format.ts`. `verbs/{ask,poll}.ts` are local dispatcher / diagnostic helpers. |
| `engines/engine.ts`, `engines/types.ts`, `engines/registry.ts`, `engines/teammate-record.ts` | The `Engine` interface, the shared request/result/value types (decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Engine interface" and §"Capabilities"), the invocation-scoped `EngineRegistry`, and the abstract `TeammateRecord` base whose subclasses live under `engines/<kind>/persistence.ts`. |
| `engines/claude/` | The Claude engine. `claude-engine.ts` implements `Engine`; `persistence.ts` owns the `ClaudeTeammateRecord` extension while path construction is shared through `persistence/paths.ts`. The verb bodies live in `engines/claude/<verb>.ts` and are reached through the verb layer. |
| `engines/codex/` | The Codex engine. `engine.ts` implements `Engine`; `persistence.ts` owns the base record plus `/tmp/teammate-codex/<name>/` registry-directory builders including `last-turn.json`; `rollout.ts` reads `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` for last replies, token usage, activity fallback, and killed-name explicit resume routing; `history.ts` lists and expands rollout-backed thread ids for `tm history`. Codex-supported verbs use the app-server daemon; unsupported teammate verbs return structured `not-supported` results through the same Engine method surface. |
| `persistence/atomic-file.ts` | Atomic write primitives (`atomicWrite`, `reserveExclusive`, `readIfPresent`) — every teammate-record write goes through these so a concurrent verb never observes a torn file. |
| `persistence/identity-store.ts` | The only file that writes / reads `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json` — decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"TeammateRecord" enforcement. `reserve` is the `O_CREAT \| O_EXCL` spawn-time race winner; `list()` recursively scans `/tmp/teammate*` (including the Codex registry root, since `codex/foo`'s base record lives at `/tmp/teammate-codex/foo.json`) and relies on schema parse + path-segment reconstruction to keep daemon-private files out of the listing. Identity root is overridable via `CLAUDEMUX_IDENTITY_ROOT` for tests. |
| `persistence/history-index.ts` | Forward-only tm-owned JSONL index for `tm history`. Lifecycle verbs append session and close-status events; the query layer folds them into records. It never reads or imports retired Markdown ledger files. |
| `persistence/paths.ts` | Shared path builders for the Claude `/tmp/teammate-*` protocol files, `/tmp/claude-idle/*`, `tmuxSessionName`, and `encodeProjectDir` — the TypeScript side of the path-builder discipline ([decision cross-process-cross-platform-invariants](/.agents/decisions/cross-process-cross-platform-invariants.md)). |
| `persistence/identity-writer.ts` | `ProductionIdentityStore` — the verb-layer-facing `IdentityStore.remove()` seam (`killVerb` uses it after a successful kill). |
| `identity/name.ts` | `validateTeammateName` — single-segment + nested-name (`flow/flow-1`) validator. Rejects `__` only when the name also contains `/` (the one case where the `/` → `__` tmux encoding would round-trip ambiguously); legacy flat names like `flow__1` remain reachable. |
| `identity/router.ts` | `ProductionTeammateRouter` reads the identity JSON. Production wiring may run per-engine identity migrators for live pre-JSON teammates, but routing still happens only after `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json` exists and records an engine. |
| `proc.ts` | `spawnCapture` — the `node:child_process` spawn primitive every shell-out backend is built on. |
| `tm.ts` | `TmResult`, the `EXIT_SYNC_WAIT_EXPIRED` constant (`124`, GNU `timeout(1)` convention) every wait-bearing verb returns when its `--timeout` elapses without the teammate dying, and `resolveTmBinary` — the live-teammate harness's seam for locating the user-installed `tm` PATH entry (honors `CLAUDEMUX_TM`). |
| `tmux.ts` | The `tmux` backend — `runTmux`, used by every verb that queries tmux. |
| `column.ts` | The `column` backend — `runColumn` pipes tab-separated rows through `column -t` for table-rendering verbs. |
| `grep.ts` | The `grep` backend — `runGrep` matches input against a regex with `grep -qE` for the `poll` verb. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/engine.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/engine.ts) | `CodexEngine implements Engine`: spawn/send/wait/list/status/kill/resume/last/ctx/history, with `send` / `wait` returning final assistant text on stdout and storing the raw app-server Turn envelope for `tm last --verbose`, `resume` relaunching a daemon by explicit thread id or by Codex `thread/list` latest-thread selection, `history` listing rollout-backed thread ids by cwd, `list` and `status` probing daemon health plus Codex thread status, and structured not-supported results for capabilities Codex does not expose. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts) | Compatibility re-export surface for Codex-specific callers and tests. Implementation lives in `ask.ts`, `verb-lifecycle.ts`, `verb-turns.ts`, `verb-state.ts`, and `verb-common.ts`; the main teammate-targeted CLI dispatch goes through `verbs/<v>.ts` and the Engine registry. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/supervisor.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/supervisor.ts) | Per-teammate daemon lifecycle — `spawnDaemon`, `daemonAlive`, `readDaemonState`, `listDaemons`, `reapDaemon`, and the per-call bookkeeping helpers. Owns spawn-detached, lock-based duplicate-spawn protection, the unix-socket readiness probe, optional UI IPC bridge process launch, and SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL reap. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/rpc.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/rpc.ts) | The WebSocket JSON-RPC client. Routes incoming frames by envelope shape (`method+id+params` is a server-request, `method+params` is a notification, `id+result\|error` is a response), pinned by [`plugins/claudemux/test/codex-schema.test.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/test/codex-schema.test.ts). |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/ipc-bridge.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/ipc-bridge.ts), [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/ui-ipc.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/ui-ipc.ts) | Optional Codex UI live-sync bridge. It connects to `${TMPDIR}/codex-ipc/ipc-$(id -u).sock` when present, initializes as a UI IPC client, broadcasts `thread-stream-state-changed` snapshots for the teammate's active thread, rebroadcasts on new UI clients, and proxies supported `thread-follower-*` requests back to the teammate app-server. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/events.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/events.ts) | Codex-private event collector. It subscribes to `item/completed`, `thread/tokenUsage/updated`, and `turn/completed`, filters by `threadId`, buckets by `turnId`, and returns a merged turn plus the latest token usage seen for that turn to the engine. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/rollout.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/rollout.ts) | Read-only Codex rollout JSONL helpers. They locate `rollout-<timestamp>-<thread-id>.jsonl`, extract the latest assistant text and token count, and expose a short activity window used when live thread status is unavailable. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/history.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/history.ts) | Codex `tm history` implementation. It scans rollout files by date directory, filters by recorded cwd, marks the live thread from `/tmp/teammate-codex/<name>/thread`, and renders list / detail output with a `tm resume <name> <thread-id>` line. |
| [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/persistence.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/persistence.ts) | Codex teammate persistence builders: base-record helpers plus `/tmp/teammate-codex/<name>/pid`, `socket`, `thread`, `started-at`, `last-seen`, `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `ipc-bridge.pid`, `ipc-bridge.stdout.log`, `ipc-bridge.stderr.log`, `meta.json`, and atomically overwritten `last-turn.json`. |
| `codex-protocol/` | Generated by `codex app-server generate-ts --experimental`. Treat as vendored ground truth; the CI drift gate (`Install codex CLI` + `codex-protocol not stale`) regenerates it on every push and asserts the diff is empty. |

`tm` holds no state between invocations — a verb is one short-lived process.
The state it reads and mutates lives outside it: tmux sessions, the `/tmp`
marker protocol, and `~/.claude/projects`. See
[domains/node-cli-orchestrator.md](/.agents/domains/node-cli-orchestrator.md)
§2–§3.

## Verb dispatch

`runCli` ([`cli/dispatch.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/cli/dispatch.ts),
re-exported by [`cli.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/cli.ts)) is the one
place that routes one CLI invocation. The order:

1. Bare `tm` → `OVERVIEW_HELP`, exit 0.
2. `tm help` / `tm -h` / `tm --help` / `tm help <verb>` → the matching entry
   from `HELP_TEXTS`, or `OVERVIEW_HELP`; an unknown verb here writes a
   stderr line plus the overview and exits 1.
3. Help pre-scan on the verb's argument list — a `-h`/`--help` before the
   first positional or before `--prompt` prints that verb's help; otherwise
   the scan stops and dispatch proceeds.
4. Removed verb (`wait-idle`, `wait-quiet`, `archive`) → the migration message from
   `REMOVED_VERB_MESSAGES`, exit 2.
5. **Engine-routed teammate verbs** — `tm ls`, `tm states`, `tm status`,
   `tm kill`, `tm spawn`, `tm send`, `tm wait`, `tm compact`, `tm resume`,
   `tm last`, `tm ctx`, `tm history`, `tm mem`, and `tm reload` build a
   `productionVerbContext` (`EngineRegistry` registered with `ClaudeEngine`
   and `CodexEngine`, `ProductionTeammateRouter` reading the identity JSON
   after any live pre-JSON teammate is migrated, and
   `ProductionIdentityStore` for identity removal) and hand off through
   `verbs/<v>.ts`.
5b. **Dispatcher-only / diagnostic verbs** — `tm poll` remains a Claude/tmux
   diagnostic; `tm doctor` assembles local health checks; `tm ask` borrows a
   Codex teammate from the pool for a one-off review turn.
6. Unknown verb → stderr line plus overview, exit 1.

Every path produces the same `{code, stdout, stderr}` `TmResult`. The process
entry in [`main.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/main.ts) writes that result
to `process.stdout` / `process.stderr` and exits with its code.

An engine method keeps its *logic* in the core but may still shell out to a
session, presentation, or matching backend: Claude's tmux-querying methods
reach `tmux` through [`tmux.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/tmux.ts); `states`
pipes rows through the real `column -t`
([`column.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/column.ts)); `poll` delegates its
regex match to the real `grep -qE` ([`grep.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/grep.ts)).
`column` and `grep` are not reimplemented in TypeScript — how `column` measures
a field's width and what `grep -E`'s POSIX dialect matches are implementation-
and platform-dependent, and the migration must preserve the installed binary's
exact behavior. Process-launch shell-outs go through `spawnCapture`
([`proc.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/proc.ts)), the one
`node:child_process` primitive.

## The launcher

[`plugins/claudemux/bin/tm`](/plugins/claudemux/bin/tm) is a thin bash
launcher. In a source plugin checkout it `exec`s
`node --experimental-transform-types --no-warnings` directly against
[`src/main.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/main.ts), with
[`resolver-register.mjs`](/plugins/claudemux/resolver-register.mjs)
mounting a small ESM resolve hook so the type-stripper accepts the tree's
extension-less and `.js` import specifiers. There is no build step and no
`node_modules/` lookup; the one runtime npm dependency, `ws`, is vendored
under [`third_party/ws/`](/plugins/claudemux/third_party/ws/)
and reached through the `#ws` subpath in the plugin's `package.json`
`imports` map. Source edits take effect on the next `tm` invocation.

The npm package path is compiled. `scripts/build-npm.mjs` bundles
[`src/main.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/main.ts) to
`plugins/claudemux/dist/tm.mjs` and the Codex IPC bridge
sidecar to `plugins/claudemux/dist/ipc-bridge-process.mjs`;
the package `bin.tm` points at `dist/tm.mjs`. See
[zero-install-type-stripping](/.agents/decisions/zero-install-type-stripping.md)
for the alternatives and the reasoning behind this shape.

## Native verbs and the conformance harness

The **conformance harness**
([`test/conformance.test.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/test/conformance.test.ts))
pins each native verb's behavior against a committed **golden** JSON file
per scenario at
[`test/goldens/<verb>/<slug>.json`](/plugins/claudemux/test/goldens). For
each scenario the harness runs the native handler once and asserts its
`{code, stdout, stderr}` matches the golden; a mutating verb (`kill`,
`reload`) additionally pins its post-state to a sibling
`<slug>.fs.json`. tmux is faked — the native verb reaches it through
`CLAUDEMUX_TMUX` — so the harness needs no real tmux. The wall clock and the
per-scenario name generator are both deterministic, so goldens are byte-
stable across runs.

To regenerate the goldens from current source (after an intended behavior
change) run:

```bash
UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 npx vitest run test/conformance.test.ts
```

and review the `git diff` before committing.

The `claudemux-core` CI job runs on both Linux and macOS because native verbs
still shell out to platform-sensitive binaries (`column`, `grep`), and that
surface is what the cross-platform matrix pins.

The hot-path verbs (`spawn`, `send`, `wait`, `compact`, `resume`) cannot run
their full round-trip under the conformance fake — there is no real `claude`
REPL, and the fake `tmux` does not model `send-keys` / `load-buffer` /
`paste-buffer` faithfully. They are conformance-checked only at every exit
*before* the tmux send path: argument parsing, validation errors, the
`require_session` / `repo not found` paths, and other pre-send guardrails. The
full round-trip is the
[live-teammate suite's](/plugins/claudemux/test/integration) job.

`doctor` is migrated but not in the conformance harness: it reports the path
to the *current* `tm` binary, which differs between the production launcher
and the dev launcher. A native-only unit test in `cli.test.ts` pins the
verb's output structure.

Help text and removed-verb migration messages are pinned by `cli.test.ts`'s
assertions against `HELP_TEXTS` / `OVERVIEW_HELP` / `REMOVED_VERB_MESSAGES`
in [`help.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/help.ts) — that module is itself
the golden. A reviewer sees help changes as `help.ts` diffs in the same
commit that changes the verb.

## The live-teammate integration harness

The conformance harness fakes tmux and runs no `claude`, so it cannot reach the
racy hot path — `spawn`, `send`, `wait`, `compact`, `resume` — whose behavior
is the interaction of `tmux send-keys`, a real REPL, the claudemux hooks, and
the `/tmp/claude-idle` turn signal. The **live-teammate integration harness**
([`test/integration/`](/plugins/claudemux/test/integration)) covers that
gap: it spawns real `claude` teammates through `tm` and asserts the round-trips
complete.

It is opt-in — slow, and it needs a working Claude Code install — so it runs
under its own [`vitest.integration.config.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/vitest.integration.config.ts)
and its files are named `*.itest.ts`, never discovered by `npm test` or CI.
[`harness.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/test/integration/harness.ts) is the
framework: a temp-dispatcher fixture, a `tm` runner, the `~/.claude.json`
directory-trust seeding a teammate needs to boot past the workspace-trust
dialog, and a precondition probe that *skips* the suite — rather than failing
it — when no live teammate can run. Every `tm` call resolves through `resolveTmBinary` / `CLAUDEMUX_TM`. Default
resolution finds the user-facing launcher at
[`plugins/claudemux/bin/tm`](/plugins/claudemux/bin/tm); set `CLAUDEMUX_TM`
to point at any other launcher (a checked-out fork, a wrapper for
profiling) without touching the suite:

```bash
cd plugins/claudemux
npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts
```

Why trust is seeded by a targeted write rather than an isolated config dir
is [decision live-teammate-integration-harness](/.agents/decisions/live-teammate-integration-harness.md);
the run instructions are the suite's own
[README](/plugins/claudemux/test/integration/README.md).
