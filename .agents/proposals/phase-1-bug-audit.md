# Phase 1 — Bug audit for the 0.8.1+unreleased local install

> **Status — Resolved snapshot.** A point-in-time bug audit at HEAD `dcc1636`.
> Its findings drove [decision codex-engine-flag](/.agents/decisions/codex-engine-flag.md)

Snapshot of what's broken (or just *looks* broken) at HEAD `dcc1636` on
`next`. Each entry is **observation → evidence → root cause → proposed
fix**, ordered by the priority the user named:
codex prefix > SessionStart hook > MCP > anything else.

## A. Codex engine selection via `codex-` name prefix

- **Observation.** `tm spawn <name>` forks on whether `<name>` starts with
  `codex-` to decide engine. The user named this as the load-bearing
  redesign of this iteration.
- **Evidence.** `isCodexTarget` is defined at
  [`plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts) and
  used at four sites in `native.ts` (`1149`, `2051`, `2310`, `2445`) plus
  the `codexAsk` pool filter in `plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts`.
- **Root cause.** [Decision codex-driver §1](/.agents/decisions/codex-driver.md)
  committed to the prefix as a one-helper-four-call-sites stage-4
  shortcut. The shortcut is now load-bearing surface contract — the cost
  is in the four-character namespace carve-out, the silent demotion of
  any teammate named `codex-…`, and the absence of a clean growth path
  for a third engine.
- **Proposed fix.** A new explicit `--engine <claude|codex>` flag at
  `tm spawn`, with engine identity persisted in the existing two
  per-teammate registries (no new files), a resolver that supersedes
  `isCodexTarget`, and a one-minor deprecation window for the prefix.
  Full rationale + alternatives in
  [decision codex-engine-flag (draft)](/.agents/decisions/codex-engine-flag.md).

## B. SessionStart hook "did not fire" warning is a false alarm

- **Observation.** `tm spawn claudemux-doc` printed
  `WARN: claudemux-doc … did not signal ready within 18s (no SessionStart
  hook fire — the plugin's on-session-start.sh may not be loaded …)`. The
  user reasonably read that as "the hook is not loaded".
- **Evidence.** The hook *did* fire — it was just one second past the
  poll budget:
  - `/tmp/teammate-claudemux-doc.cwd` mtime `2026-05-23 21:17:01` (written
    by `tm spawn`).
  - `/tmp/teammate-claudemux-doc.sid` mtime `2026-05-23 21:17:01` (written
    by `tm spawn`).
  - `/tmp/teammate-claudemux-doc.ready` mtime `2026-05-23 21:17:20`.
    Only the hook touches this file (`tm spawn` only `rm`s it — see
    [`engines/claude/spawn.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/claude/spawn.ts)
    and
    [`hooks/on-session-start.sh:90`](/plugins/claudemux/hooks/on-session-start.sh)),
    so its 19-second-later mtime is direct evidence of the hook running.
  - Hook produces `/tmp/claude-idle/_on-stop.log` actively — on-stop is
    firing for the dispatcher session every Stop, confirming `hooks.json`
    loaded cleanly (the bundle is "all or nothing"; the same JSON wires
    SessionStart and Stop).
- **Root cause.** `pollReady` in
  [`engines/claude/spawn.ts`](/plugins/claudemux/src/engines/claude/spawn.ts)
  loops 60 × 300 ms = **18 s**. Booting Opus 4.7 on a 1 M context window with a stack of
  user-scope plugins consistently takes ~19 s on this machine, so the
  poll loses by a single iteration. The WARN copy then misleads by
  hypothesising a load failure.
- **Proposed fix.** Two-part, both required:
  1. **Raise the poll budget** to ~36 s (120 × 300 ms). The window is for
     `claude` to print its first prompt and the hook to fire once — any
     value short of "claude is definitely wedged" is acceptable; 36 s is
     comfortable for the slowest observed cold boot without being a
     surprising wait when it *is* wedged.
  2. **Rewrite the WARN copy** so it describes what was actually observed,
     not a speculative cause. Replace the "may not be loaded" sentence
     with "claude has not signalled ready in `Ns` — it may still be
     starting (1 M context, plugin discovery) or wedged on a permission
     dialog. The verb continues; subsequent `tm send` / `wait` will
     surface a real hang."
- **on-stop sibling check.** Decisively **not** affected by the same
  root cause. Evidence: `_on-stop.log` shows the dispatcher's
  `9eceb6b9-…` session writing on every Stop in the last hour;
  `on-stop.sh` is reached via the same `hooks.json`, so if it loaded for
  one event it loaded for all. This teammate's own first Stop hasn't
  landed yet (no `<sid>.last` for the current sid `3b127467`), so we'll
  observe it once the first turn finishes — but there is no known route
  for hook bundles to load partially.

## C. "1 MCP server failed" — not a claudemux bug

- **Observation.** This REPL's status bar reports `1 MCP server failed`.
- **Evidence.** The Claude CLI log directory
  `~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs/-Users-user-Development-claudemux-doc/`
  holds per-server logs. The latest connect attempt for each server in
  this session (`3b127467-…`):

  | MCP server | failure mode | shipped by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `claude-ai-Gmail` | `mcp_unauthorized_no_token` (OAuth not configured) | claude.ai Connectors |
  | `claude-ai-Google-Calendar` | `mcp_unauthorized_no_token` | claude.ai Connectors |
  | `claude-ai-Google-Drive` | `mcp_unauthorized_no_token` | claude.ai Connectors |
  | an internal devops MCP server | an internal Git host unreachable (`go get` EOF) | an internal devops plugin |
  | another internal devops MCP server | `Failed to open SSE stream: Not Found` | an internal devops plugin |

  The claudemux-shipped `plugin-feishu-channel-feishu` has **no
  2026-05-23 log file at all** under this cwd; the most recent entry is
  `2026-05-21T09:11Z`, before this session started. That's correct: the
  `feishu-channel` plugin's entry in the user's
  `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` has `scope: project` with
  `projectPath: /Users/user/Development/claudemux` (the dispatcher),
  so it is not enabled for this teammate's cwd `…/claudemux-doc`. Nothing
  claudemux ships is failing.
- **Root cause.** Cosmetic Claude Code reporting: the status bar
  aggregates *five* failed servers down to "1 MCP server failed" — the
  count and the message are both misleading. The failures themselves are
  external (claude.ai OAuth not configured, an internal Git host
  unreachable from this network, an internal SSE endpoint 404).
- **Proposed fix.** None inside claudemux. Hand the punch list above to
  the user so they can: (a) authorise the claude.ai Connectors they
  actually want, (b) check whether the internal devops plugin still
  needs to be enabled on this cwd given the network reach issues. The
  Claude Code status-bar undercount is upstream; we can mention it in
  the GitHub issue tracker but it does not block this iteration.

## D. Smaller things noticed in passing

- **`feishu` MCP cwd alignment.** As above, `feishu-channel` is enabled
  for the dispatcher only. If the dispatcher skill assumes "teammates
  inherit the feishu channel", that assumption is wrong — but a quick
  scan of the dispatcher skill doesn't show such an assumption. Flag for
  follow-up only if a real workflow trips on it.
- **`tm spawn`'s deprecation-warning path doesn't yet exist.** Today
  `tm spawn codex-1` succeeds silently; the proposed `--engine` change
  (item A) introduces the first deprecation warning surface in `tm`. The
  warning channel is stderr, alongside the existing `spawned: …` /
  `ready: …` lines — no new conventions needed.
- **`isCodexTarget` is exported.** It's used externally (`native.ts`
  imports it from `plugins/claudemux/src/engines/codex/verbs.ts`). When item A lands, the export goes
  away and the resolver in `paths.ts` takes its place. Caught here so
  the implementer doesn't preserve a backwards-compat re-export by
  habit.

## Approval gates

The user asked for *bug list + codex redesign* before any implementation.
The deliverables for this gate are:

1. **This file** — Phase 1 bug audit (`.agents/proposals/phase-1-bug-audit.md`).
2. **Decision codex-engine-flag draft** — the `--engine` flag design
   (`.agents/decisions/codex-engine-flag.md`, status: `Proposed`).

Nothing in `plugins/claudemux/` has been edited. The proposal does not
ship.
