# feishu-channel

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) **channel** plugin for Feishu
(飞书). Receive Feishu messages in a running Claude Code session and reply back —
all over a long-lived WebSocket connection, so no public webhook URL is needed.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) **v2.1.80 or later** — channels
  are a research-preview feature and are not available in earlier versions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **v22 or later** — the channel server runtime.
  The plugin installs its own dependencies on first launch.
- A Feishu **self-built app** with the Bot capability (see below).

## Install

Add the claudemux marketplace, then install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add excitedjs/claudemux
/plugin install feishu-channel@claudemux
```

## Configure your Feishu app

### 1. Create the Feishu self-built app

Create a self-built app on the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn)
(open.larksuite.com for Lark). These steps happen in the Feishu console:

1. Create a new **self-built app** (企业自建应用).
2. Enable the **Bot** capability (添加机器人能力).
3. Under **Event Subscription** (事件订阅), choose the **long-connection** mode.
   This plugin connects outbound over a WebSocket — you do not configure a
   request URL.
4. Subscribe to the events the channel handles:
   - `im.message.receive_v1` — inbound chat messages.
   - `drive.notice.comment_add_v1` — new comments and replies on Feishu
     documents. See the note below before relying on this one.
5. Grant the permission scopes the bot needs: reading incoming messages,
   sending messages as the bot, adding and removing message reactions (for the
   `react` tool and the received indicator), and — for document comments —
   reading document comments and document metadata. The app's permission
   console lists each scope.
6. **Publish a release** of the app so the bot and its permissions take effect.
7. From the app's credentials page, copy the **App ID** and **App Secret**.

> **Note on the document-comment event.** A `drive.notice.comment_add_v1`
> payload carries only the comment's identifiers — not its text, nor the
> document's title. The channel fetches both from Feishu to render a usable
> notification, so the bot needs the document-comment and document-metadata
> **read** scopes (step 5 above). Without them, a comment is still delivered,
> but its text and title are left as a placeholder. If your app cannot
> subscribe to this event at all, the channel still works for chat messages —
> only document-comment delivery is affected.

### 2. Save the credentials

In a Claude Code session with the plugin installed, run:

```
/feishu-channel:configure <App ID> <App Secret>
```

The command saves the credentials to the channel's env file, asks which
**group-message policy** to use (see "Access control" below), and immediately
verifies the credentials against Feishu, so an invalid App Secret is caught
right then — not at the next launch. Run it with no arguments to be prompted
for the values interactively. Re-run it any time to update the credentials or
the group policy. For an international **Lark** app, the command accepts a base
URL — see `/feishu-channel:configure`'s own guidance.

<details>
<summary>Manual fallback</summary>

The command is the supported path. If you cannot run it, the channel reads its
credentials from `~/.claude/channels/feishu/.env`:

```
FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

`FEISHU_APP_ID` / `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` set in the process environment are used
as a fallback. The server refuses to start if neither source supplies both
values.

## Enable the channel

A plugin from a third-party marketplace is not on Anthropic's official channel
allowlist, so launch Claude Code with the development-channels flag:

```
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:feishu-channel@claudemux
```

Listing the plugin in `.mcp.json` is not enough on its own — Claude Code only
registers a channel when it is named on the command line. The flag also does
not override an organization's `channelsEnabled` policy; if channels are
disabled org-wide, the channel will not load.

## Proxy environments

The channel's MCP server is launched with the HTTP proxy environment variables
(`HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`) cleared, so it connects to Feishu **directly**.
A proxy configured for your Claude Code session — for example in
`~/.claude/settings.json` — still applies to the rest of the session; it just
does not apply to this server, which does not need it. The clearing is done in
the plugin's `.mcp.json`.

The server therefore needs a direct network path to Feishu — `open.feishu.cn`
and the `*.feishu.cn` WebSocket endpoint. On a network that can only reach
Feishu through a proxy, this channel is not currently configurable for that.

## How it works

The plugin ships an MCP server (over stdio) that declares the `claude/channel`
capability.

**Inbound.** The server opens a WebSocket to the Feishu Open Platform
(`lark.WSClient`) and receives the events the bot is subscribed to. Each event
type is handled by its own registered handler, which decodes the payload and —
for chat messages — runs access control. An approved event is delivered into
the Claude Code session as a `notifications/claude/channel` notification, which
Claude sees as a `<channel source="feishu">` block. The block's `kind`
attribute says which kind of event it is:

- `kind="message"` — a chat message. Carries `chat_id`, `message_id`,
  `chat_type` (`p2p` or `group`), and `sender_id`.
- `kind="doc_comment"` — a new comment or reply on a Feishu document. Carries
  `file_token`, `file_type`, `comment_id`, an optional `reply_id`,
  `notice_type` (`add_comment` or `add_reply`), `commenter_id`, `mentioned_bot`,
  and `doc_url` when the document link could be resolved. The block body
  carries the comment text and the document title — both fetched from Feishu,
  since a comment event payload itself carries only the comment's identifiers.

New event types are added by registering one more handler — the channel is not
hardcoded to a fixed set of events.

**Received indicator.** Once a chat message clears access control and is
delivered into the session, the channel adds a 👀 reaction to it on Feishu —
so the sender can see their message landed and Claude is on it. The reaction is
removed automatically when Claude replies into that chat: every message in the
chat that was still awaiting a reply has its indicator cleared. Document
comments are not IM messages and carry no such reaction.

**Outbound.** The server exposes three MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reply` | Send a text message into a chat (`chat_id` + `text`). A long reply is split into several Feishu messages automatically. |
| `react` | Add an emoji reaction to a message (`message_id` + `emoji`). |
| `edit_message` | Replace the text of a message the channel sent (`message_id` + `text`). |

The terminal operator sees the inbound message and Claude's tool calls; the
reply text itself appears in Feishu, not in the terminal.

## Access control

Messages are gated before they reach Claude, so an open bot is not an open door
to the session:

- **Direct messages** from an unknown sender are not delivered. The channel
  replies with a one-time **pairing code**; an operator approves the sender out
  of band, after which their messages are delivered.
- **Group messages** are gated by the `groupPolicy` setting: `block` (the bot
  ignores groups entirely), `allowlist` (each group is authorized individually,
  by pairing), or `follow-user` (the bot answers an @-mention from anyone on
  the allowlist, in any group — no per-group setup). `/feishu-channel:configure`
  asks which to use.

The policy lives in `~/.claude/channels/feishu/access.json`. A corrupt or
missing file is reported and the channel falls back to safe defaults rather
than failing open. Approvals — pairing codes, the allowlist, and group policy —
are managed through the bundled `access` skill.

To diagnose why a message was not delivered, launch Claude Code with
`FEISHU_CHANNEL_DEBUG=1` in the environment — the channel then logs every
gated-out message to stderr with the reason it was dropped.

## Development

```bash
cd plugins/feishu-channel
npm install
npm test          # run the unit suite (vitest)
npm run typecheck
```

Core logic lives in `src/` as small, dependency-free modules so it can be unit
tested without a live Feishu connection or a running MCP server. Each Feishu
event type is a self-contained handler under `src/handlers/`, registered with
the event registry in `src/server.ts` — adding support for a new event is a
new handler module plus one registration line. `scripts/configure.ts` is the
credential factory behind `/feishu-channel:configure`; its pure logic is
type-checked and tested alongside `src/`. Tests are in `test/` and run on
`vitest`; input-heavy functions are covered with property-based tests via
`fast-check`. The same suite runs in CI under the `feishu-channel` job.

`test/feishu-live.ts` is a separate integration test that talks to the real
Feishu Open Platform. It is not a `*.test.ts` file, so `npm test` does not run
it by default; run it explicitly with credentials in the environment:

```bash
FEISHU_APP_ID=... FEISHU_APP_SECRET=... npx vitest run ./test/feishu-live.ts
```

CI runs it on every commit using repository secrets. With no credentials it
skips itself.

`test/dogfood-markdown.ts` is a manual tool, not part of `npm test` or CI. It
drives the production `reply` / `edit_message` path through `handleTool` and
posts to a real chat, so a human can confirm the card renders correctly in the
Feishu client — the one thing the unit suite cannot assert. Run it after
changing the outbound payload:

```bash
tsx test/dogfood-markdown.ts <chat_id>
```
