 * Single-instance lock for the Feishu inbound connection.
 *
 * The channel plugin loads in every Claude Code session it is enabled for, and
 * each session's MCP server would otherwise open its own Feishu long-connection
 * WebSocket with the same app credentials. Feishu delivers each inbound event
 * to exactly one of an app's connections, so N connections silently split the
 * inbound messages N ways — most messages never reach the session the operator
 * is watching.
 *
 * This lock elects exactly one server process — the holder — to open the
 * inbound WebSocket; every other process stands by. The lock is a pidfile: the
 * holder writes its PID, and another instance treats the file as held only
 * when that PID belongs to a live process. A crashed holder leaves a stale
 * pidfile whose PID is dead, so the next instance reclaims it — a crash can
 * never wedge the channel permanently shut.
