 * The Feishu platform boundary.
 *
 * Everything that talks to Feishu — the inbound long-lived WebSocket and the
 * outbound message API — sits behind the `FeishuTransport` interface. The
 * channel server depends only on that interface, so its wiring can be
 * exercised against an injected fake with no live connection.
 *
 * The transport is event-type agnostic. `start` is handed a route table
 * mapping each Feishu event_type to a callback and registers every entry
 * with the SDK's event dispatcher; decoding a specific event's payload is the
 * job of that event's handler, not this module. Adding a new event type to
 * the channel therefore never touches this file.
 *
 * Only one server process per machine opens the inbound WebSocket. `start`
 * acquires a single-instance lock (see `./instance-lock`); a process that
 * loses the lock stands by and polls, so a crashed holder is taken over.
