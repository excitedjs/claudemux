/**
 * The event registry — the channel's extensibility seam.
 *
 * A Feishu channel reacts to more than one kind of Feishu event. Rather than
 * branch the server on each event_type, every event type is implemented as a
 * self-contained `EventHandler`: it declares the event_type it subscribes to
 * and turns one raw event payload into a `ChannelDelivery` (or `null` to drop
 * it). An `EventRegistry` holds the handlers; the server resolves one per
 * inbound event by its event_type.
 *
 * Adding a new Feishu event to the channel is therefore: write one handler
 * module, register it once. The server pipeline and the transport do not
 * change.
