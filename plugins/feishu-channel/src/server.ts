/**
 * The Feishu channel MCP server.
 *
 * This module assembles the channel: it declares the `claude/channel`
 * capability, exposes the outbound tools, and runs the inbound pipeline —
 * which is now a thin dispatcher over an `EventRegistry`. Each Feishu event
 * type is a registered handler (see `./events` and `./handlers/`); the core
 * only resolves a handler by event_type, runs it, and delivers its result.
 *
 * The channel logic lives in `createChannelCore`, which depends only on a
 * `FeishuTransport` and a notifier callback — so the inbound and outbound
 * paths are unit-testable against fakes, with no MCP stdio and no live
 * Feishu connection. `main` is the thin process entry point that wires the
 * core to a real MCP `Server`, a real transport, and graceful shutdown.
