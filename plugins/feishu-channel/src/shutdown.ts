/**
 * Graceful shutdown.
 *
 * The channel server holds an open WebSocket and timers that pin the event
 * loop, so it must actively release them: a termination signal or the loss of
 * its stdio connection has to drive a clean exit, or the process leaks and
 * keeps a Feishu connection slot occupied.
 *
 * `ShutdownCoordinator` collects named cleanup tasks and runs them exactly
 * once, whatever triggers the shutdown. A watchdog timer force-exits if the
 * cleanup itself hangs — a stuck `close()` would otherwise leave the process
 * running forever, which is just another way to leak it. Every external
 * effect — OS signals, timers, process exit, error logging — is an injectable
 * dependency, so the whole lifecycle is unit-testable without signalling or
 * killing the test runner.
