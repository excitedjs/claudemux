/**
 * Self-managed git worktree helpers — used by every engine that drives
 * a teammate headlessly and has no native worktree flag of its own.
 *
 * Both the Codex daemon and the Claude stream-json broker run `claude`
 * / `codex` non-interactively, so claudemux drives `git worktree add` /
 * `git worktree remove` itself rather than relying on an interactive
 * `--worktree` flag; the resulting layout is identical:
 *
 *     <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>     ← runtime cwd
 *     branch: worktree-<slug>             ← matches `claude --worktree`
 *
 * Decisions:
 *
 *   - `baseRef = HEAD`. The user's pinned default for both engines;
 *     Claude's side configures this through its `--settings` worktree
 *     block, ours is just `git worktree add -b worktree-<slug> <path>
 *     HEAD`.
 *
 *   - `--no-worktree` does not call these helpers; the daemon's cwd
 *     stays at the repo root.
