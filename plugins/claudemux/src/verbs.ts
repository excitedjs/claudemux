/**
 * The catalog of `tm` verbs the core re-exposes as MCP tools.
 *
 * The core exposes the *whole* `tm` verb set — the migration's exit gate is
 * "reproduces today's `tm` behavior for every verb", so no verb is carved
 * out. Each verb becomes one MCP tool; `core.ts` runs it natively (`native.ts`)
 * or shells out to `tm`, per verb, as the strangler migration moves verbs
 * across. The `help` verb is intentionally absent: the MCP tool schemas are
 * themselves the dispatcher-facing help surface, so a `tm help` passthrough
 * would be redundant.
 *
 * The `summary` strings are short, lifted from `tm --help`. Rich per-argument
 * schemas — "the MCP tool descriptions become the new `tm --help`" — are a
 * Phase D task; until then a verb tool forwards an opaque argument vector.
 * The one exception is the registry-affecting verbs (`registry !== 'none'`):
 * their tools take a required structured `repo` field, because the core keys
 * the registry on the teammate identity and must read it as data, not parse
 * it back out of the argument vector (see `core.ts`).
