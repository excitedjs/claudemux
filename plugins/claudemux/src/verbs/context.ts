/**
 * `VerbContext` — the dependency bundle every verb-layer default impl
 * takes. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Verb is the abstraction" calls out the four
 * verb-side primitives:
 *
 *  - `engines` — the read-only registry view; `lsVerb` / `statesVerb`
 *    fan out over `registered()`.
 *  - `router` — name → engine resolution; `statusVerb` / `killVerb` /
 *    every single-teammate verb consults this. `null` is the
 *    "no such teammate" case.
 *  - `engineContext` — the shared environment every Engine method
 *    receives; verbs pass it through unmodified.
 *  - `identity` — the writer for the base `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json`
 *    file; `killVerb` calls `remove()` after a successful kill so a
 *    later `tm spawn` of the same name is not blocked by a stale
 *    identity record.
 *
 * Phase 1 has no concrete engines and no real identity store; the
 * verbs still type-check against this bundle, and the empty / no-op
 * Phase 1 implementations land them on the "not found" branch.
