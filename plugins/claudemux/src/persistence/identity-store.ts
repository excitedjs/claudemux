/**
 * The identity store — the one place that writes and reads
 * `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json`. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"TeammateRecord" anchors this
 * file as the single source of truth for the base `TeammateRecord`, and
 * §"Enforcement against silent regression" pins the constraint: no other
 * file in `plugins/claudemux/src/` may touch the JSON marker.
 *
 * Three surfaces matter:
 *
 *  - `reserve(record)` is the spawn-time write. It uses `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`
 *    against `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json`; a second concurrent `tm spawn`
 *    of the same name fails with `EEXIST`, which the verb formats as a
 *    "name already taken" error. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Engine identity is the
 *    JSON's `engine` field" makes this the authoritative race winner —
 *    whichever engine reserves first owns the name, the loser sees
 *    `already-exists`. The reservation is atomic enough on POSIX rename
 *    semantics that a `tm spawn ... --engine claude` on one terminal
 *    and a `tm spawn ... --engine codex` on another in the same
 *    millisecond never both succeed.
 *
 *  - `read(name)` is the per-verb identity lookup. The router calls it
 *    once per CLI invocation to map a teammate name to its engine kind.
 *    Returns `null` for "no such teammate" (the data outcome, not an
 *    error).
 *
 *  - `list()` enumerates every reserved teammate by reading
 *    `/tmp/teammate-*.json`. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Verb is the abstraction"
 *    relies on this for `tm ls`'s engine-agnostic listing — the verb
 *    asks for "every teammate identity" without knowing per-engine
 *    persistence shapes.
 *
 *  - `remove(name)` is `tm kill`'s identity bookkeeping. The verb calls
 *    it after a successful kill so a later `tm spawn` of the same name
 *    is not blocked by a stale identity file.
